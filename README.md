# Net_Worth_Charting
A collection of scripts that come together to create a automatic net worth charting system based on information from your mint account. 

## Synopsis

This is a collection of python, php and HTML/JS scripts that can be used together or seperate in order to create an automatic net worth charting mechanism for your website. The components are seperated enough that if you do not need to chart, you can just use the python bits to insert into your MySql database. This was built quickly and without any sort of design in mind. All edits and suggestions are welcome!

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I needed a net worth system in place for my blog ObscureCoder.com and this was how I made it happen. 

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
