# Net_Worth_Charting
A collection of scripts that come together to create a automatic net worth charting system based on information from your mint account. 

## Disclaimer 
This code was built quickly with aweful coding practice...Enjoy!

## Synopsis

This is a collection of python, php and HTML/JS scripts that can be used together or seperate in order to create an automatic net worth charting mechanism for your website. The components are seperated enough that if you do not need to chart, you can just use the python bits to insert into your MySql database. This was built quickly and without any sort of design in mind. All edits and suggestions are welcome!

## Motivation

I needed a net worth system in place for my blog ObscureCoder.com and this was how I made it happen. 

## Installation

All scripts are available in this github, grab the files you need adjust to your own set up.

## API Reference

The PDF should provide sufficient information.
